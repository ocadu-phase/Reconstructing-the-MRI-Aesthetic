\subsection{Segmentation}

The main objective of this project was to determine if the physicians/clinicians/technicians are able to obtain more meaningful information when given more depth information through a holographic print.  To give this type of information, structural patterns within the model must be apparent. To achieve this we used a data-set of a human brain containing a tumor. We believe that the depth information inherently found in holography, will make the location of the tumor become apparent.  As an intermediate step we need to develop geometry for each of the salient structures of the brain, mainly the white and gray matter, as well as the tumor and other abnormal tissues surrounding the tumor.  This is where segmentation algorithms are needed.\\

There are several different approaches that have been found throughout the literature \cite{pham2000current}.  But they all stem from the same set of core ideas.  In this project we explored both automatic and semi-automatic methods.
